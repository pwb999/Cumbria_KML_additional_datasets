This folder will contain various files either from OSM or OS Opendata. Please comply with their respective licences restrictions and acknowledge their copyright.

The files are in either KML or KMZ format. KML files are native to Google Earth and other applications. The KMZ format is simply a compressed or zipped version of the KML file and is used to save storage space.

Copy the KML or KMZ file to a local directory and then open it. It should be recognised as the format for ORGANIC MAPS. The file will then be imported into the BOOKMARKS tab of this application.
